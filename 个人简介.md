ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @haoqwenie!

ðŸ‘€ I'm passionate about:
- Mastering penetration hacking program development, vulnerability detection, and attack techniques.
- Proficient in big data cleaning, processing, and analysis.
- Skilled in programming languages like Python and Java for independent AI technology development.
- Having excellent teamwork and communication skills to effectively collaborate on projects.
- Participated in Google's GDELT project, proficient in using Google BigQuery, and achieved the level of a Google Big Data Analyst.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning and have hands-on experience in:
1. Penetration hacking program development:
   - Developed a penetration hacking program covering various vulnerability detection and attack methods, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and file inclusion.
   - Designed a series of anti-tracking and encryption algorithms to enhance the program's security and stealth.
   - Completed the entire product lifecycle from design to deployment, making hacking attacks and vulnerability detection more efficient and precise.

2. Big data cleaning and analysis:
   - Collected and cleaned massive data from various sources, used Python scripts to convert it into easily processable formats like Excel and i2 notebook.
   - Utilized Spark and Hadoop for data analysis and processing, uncovering valuable information such as suspect behavior data and crime preferences.
   - Gained hands-on experience with Google's GDELT project and became proficient in using Google BigQuery for big data analysis.

3. AI technology development:
   - Participated in the development of Tsinghua University's deep learning-based GLM-130B system, implemented using Python libraries like TensorFlow and Keras.
   - Independently completed the design and coding of model algorithms, implementing cutting-edge deep learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).
